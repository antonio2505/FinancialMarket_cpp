 * -principal    :             Principale,the amount of the original invesment.
 * -comp_interest: Compound interest: Interest that is accrued over time and added to
                    the principal as regular interest payments are made at each period
 * -C_comp_interest: Continuous compounding: As the number of periods increase,
                    the effect of compound interest becomes more pronounced. For
                    example, compound interest paid at the end of every month will
                    produce more than at a yearly payment schedule.
 * -present_value : Present value: When a set of scheduled cash flows and an interest
                    rate are defined, it is possible to calculate the present value of
                    those cash flows
